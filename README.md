# Singly-linked-list
I'm an IT undergraduate student learning to code this is one of my practice code.
I did a lot of work making it as refine and easy to understand.
it only have less options
create,display,insert end ,concatinate

it will be updated soon with options like sorting the list and insert start,insert at 
,delete at etc

UPDATE 
Final Version:
This is the final version of the code and it Now has 11 functions,
they are necessary  to understand and implement the concept of Singly Linked Lists.
1.CREATE
2.SEARCH
3.Concatinate
4.Insert AT Start
5.Insert AT End
6.Insertat
7.Delete AT Start
8.Delete AT End
9.Deleteat
10.DELETE BY VALUE
11.SORT
