# Singly-linked-list
I'm an IT undergraduate student learning to code this is one of my practice code.
I did a lot of work making it as refine and easy to understand.
it only have less options
create,display,insert end ,concatinate

it will be updated soon with options like sorting the list and insert start,insert at 
,delete at etc
